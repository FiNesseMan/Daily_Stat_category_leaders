This is the code used for the daily stat dump for the NHL. It includes categories like players leading in points, saves, assists, so on & so forth. The next version of the code will have better documentation. Chat GPT recommended:  "refactoring to avoid repetition. (For instance, the pattern of fetching data, processing it, and posting to Twitter is repeated several times. This could be abstracted into reusable functions.) and externalizing parameters like URL endpoints, query parameters, and limits into a configuration file or environment variables. This makes the script more flexible and easier to update without changing the code."
